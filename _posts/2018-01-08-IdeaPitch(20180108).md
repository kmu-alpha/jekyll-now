## Meeting Contents #01
 - We had looked into four companies that mentors have decided. The four companies are as follow.
	- **[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com)**
	- **[Google Maps](https://www.blog.google/products/maps/)**
	- **[Goole NBU(Next Billion Users)](https://www.blog.google/topics/next-billion-users/)**
	- **[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com)**
<br>
<br>
<br>

- We had identified values and focus of each company.
	- The idea of **Facebook**'s new mission is to "[Bring the world closer](https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10154944663901634)". 
	- **Youtube** is a company that makes a lot of money through advertising, and succeeded in a new challenge with a service called "Youtube Red", which removed the advertisement.
	- **Google Maps** is creating a service that not only shows location information, but also has reservation service.
	- **Google NBU** is targeting India once again and dreams of reaching the world again.

- Based on additional material, we decided to present one or more ideas by **Wednesday, January 10**, and have a meeting.
