![Alt text](../images/SV_experience/180109/01_Koo's_notes.png "Koo took notes")
* First, we learn the terminal. It was easy for us because we had already used the terminal just 10 minutes (10 minutes takes from WeWork to Rithm School) ago. As we can see from the Koo's notes above, 'pwd', 'cd', 'find', 'touch', 'cat' are already familiar command for us. 
* Nevertheless, it was good to study to review the basic commands. Besides, this lecture is conducted in English. We learned what we already know in Korean, so we could concentrate on the lesson.

* When we had a question about how to learn terminal and Git in an hour and a half, the speaker who was explaining "rm" said, "If you delete it using rm, it is hard to recover. I use Git to do that, and I can easily back up. "

* Using the basic commands we learned earlier, we learned to start Git with 'git init', and remotely manage git by adding and changing files. We were using Git while We were working on a team project, and We were able to understand each command with a lecture. 
* 'git add'
