- We had to stop continuously. It was because the sky was so beautiful, the air was so clean, and we had to take pictures in the beautiful scenery that opened in front of my eyes.

## 3. Close to the Golden Gate Bridge.

- As we approached the Golden Gate Bridge, it was strange that the Golden Gate Bridge was in front of me. It's always a long distance. We thought 'that's the Golden Gate Bridge.' Now it was just before the Golden Gate Bridge.

## 4. On the Golden Gate Bridge

- After we got off at Ferry 1, we rode the bike quickly and could return at 6:30.
