## Meeting Contents #02

- We thought of some ideas for two days.
	- **Minjun** says,
		- Facebook's values : "The World is One"
		- In Korea, the Facebook groups "I will deliver your message" are famous.
		- However, in a page frame, the administrator manually checks all the messages and posts them manually.
		- It would be nice to have the ability to easily post it to posts when the message arrive. <br> <br>


	- **Gaeul** says,
		- I would like to be able to set an alarm for the videos that have already been uploaded so that the videos can be viewed at that time.
		- For example, suppose you take a bus every morning at 8:00 am and watch some english conversion video on YouTube. Then you want the alarm to ring to watch the videos of the subscribed channels every morning at 8:00 am. <br> <br>


	-	**Hwancheol** says,
		-	I would like Youtube to have the ability to introduce tourists to surrounding tourist attraction based on their location. <br> <br>


	-	**Gihyun** says,
		-	I hope Google Maps will provide travelers with the ability to return to a safe route. <br> <br>


- But the ideas the team members presented were not attractive enough.
- When everyone said they had no idea, Gihyun announced a good idea for Facebook.
- The idea is as follows. <br>

	- **Facebook : Small interest changes the world.**
	- If you look at the end of the advertisement on the timeline, you get a small credit and make it available for your donation.
	- At the end of the advertisement, you will receive a credit for donation. If you do not watch ads, you will not be paid. <br> <br>


- The expected value of using this idea.
	- Facebook : Creating a corporate image that forms a donation culture.
	- Advertiser : A company can generate an image that it is involved in a donation.
	- User : Creating a positive image by showing the information that your profile that you made a donation. <br> <br>

- How to post a request for donation.
	- For example, if an earthquake occurred in Japan and you asked for a donation, you would send each piece to Facebook. Then, the Facebook company confirms the materials, and when the authentication is completed, the Facebook company makes a direct contribution request.

- 한국에도 "해피빈"이라는 기부서비스가 존재한다.
- 이 서비스의 장점과 단점에 대해서 조사를 해보았다.
	- 장점 : 기부를 할 때 네이버해피빈에서 수수료를 따로 떼지 않고 100% 전달이 된다.
	- 단점 
		-  [해피빈](https://happybean.naver.com/)에 대한 접근성이 떨어진다.
		- 켐패인을 가장한 광고들이 존재하여 신뢰도를 떨어뜨렸다.

- Our team also confirmed that Facebook are working on donations naming  [Nonprofits on Facebook](https://nonprofits.fb.com/) 
- There is also a donation service called [Happy Bean](https://happybean.naver.com/) in Naver of Korea.
	- Advantage
		- When giving donations, HappyBean will not receive any fees.
	- Disadvantage
		- 













- 이러한 조사와 회의내용들을 가지고 태훈님, 선희님과 함께 이야기를 한 내용은 아래와 같다.
	- 태훈님
		- 되게 괜찮은 아이디어이다. 다만 Facebook은 기업이기 때문에 기업이 얻는 이익에 대해서는 조금 더 고민해봐야할 것 같다.  
		- 이런 서비스를 제공했던 다른 기업에 대해서 더 분석하여 보완하면 좋겠다.
		- 마켓 리서치에 대한 조사도 이루어지면 좋겠다. <br>


	- 선희님
		- 페이스북의 단점으로 꼽히는 수많은 광고들을 장점으로 승화시킬 수 있는 좋은 아이디어라고 생각한다.

		- **Let's turn users' complaints about Facebook ads into merits.**
