## 2. What did we listen in this meet-up

In Talk 3,
- ( I referenced 'http://sanghyukchun.github.io/97/' when I heard the presentation. It explains in Korean.)
- The speaker used play chess when he attended school. He watched alphago and felt interested. 
- He talked about the overview of alpha go. The order is 'discussing game and rules','uct+random rollouts -> MCTS', 'MCTS + policy + value -> Alpha Go' and finally Alpha go zero came out. 
- First of all, he explained the rule of Go ( called 'baduk' in Asia). 
- Secondly, he explained the algorithm called UCT(Upper Confidence Bounds for Trees). 
- Thirdly, he talked about 'random rollouts'. 
- Fourth, he talked about 'alpha go' and the policy network.
- Finally, he talked about 'alpha go zero'. It use single network to predict best move and winning odds. 
( refer : https://applied-data.science/static/main/res/alpha_go_zero_cheat_sheet.png )
- He also talked 'alpha zero' and it teaches self and study. 
- (We can play alpha go zero in here : http://www.alphago-games.com/ )

( We ate dinner here. Koo and I thought if we stay in SF, we would attend meetup every night to meet people and eat dinner. )
- What was different from before, we talked with 2 people when we eat dinner. One was majoring data science and the other was interested in playing alpha go.
- We talked about the environment between Korea and US. We have many thing to say because we experienced directly. 
- We also felt 'we've learned so much because we can talk other people what we're doing'.

## 4. Talk our feelings.

- Gaeul Go : It was quite difficult to me because I don't know well about AI actually. However, it was also important experience because I can experience 
- Minjun Koo : I was surprised to see the AI I learned at school.
